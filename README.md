## üöÄ How to Build & Run

### üì¶ Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- CS 2110 Docker Image: `gtcs2110/cs2110docker-c:stable-gba`
- The mGBA emulator (runs automatically inside the container)

### üß™ Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repo & Enter the Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishruthanand08/walk-of-fire-gba.git
cd walk-of-fire-gba
```

#### 2. Start the Docker Container

```bash
./cs2110docker-gba.sh start
```

> This mounts your project into the Docker container and pulls the correct image.

#### 3. Inside the Docker Container, Run:

```bash
cd host
make mgba
```

> This compiles the `.gba` ROM and automatically launches it in the mGBA emulator.
